## Preface ##
I'm a mechatronic engineer, with experience in C, C++, C#, Matlab, and T-SQL.

I decided to use Advent of Code this year to learn Python, a language I have no experience in. This repository contains my solutions and input files. Feel free to clone this repository and replace the dayX.txt files with your own inputs.
